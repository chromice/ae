æ [æʃ] is an web application development framework written in PHP. The primary goals are:

1. To create a framework that the author — Hi. My name is Anton. Nice to meet you! — could use to solve his PHP/Web related problems quickly and efficiently.
2. Write a clean documention and some tests to ensure high quality.
3. Release into the wild and improve upon feedback.

Project is considered a success even if none of the goals have been reached. Heck, I am not sure I want to do this for my whole life, but I kinda need this myself now...

This is my contract with you. If you don't agree, you've been a lovely guest... The code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, which basically is a sticker that says "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! (and don't remove this sticker)".

p.s. None of the goals have been reached yet, but there is still determination.    
p.p.s. Unless I am dead or in a coma, I would update this note if the project is dead.
