æ [æʃ] is an web application development framework written in PHP. The primary goals are:

1. Create a framework that the author — Hi. My name is Anton. Nice to meet you! — could use to solve his PHP/Web related problems quickly and efficiently.
2. Write a clean documentation and some tests to ensure high quality.
3. Release into the wild.

Project is considered successful, even if none of the goals are reached. Heck, I am not sure if I want to do this my whole life, but I kinda need this myself... But that is my best code, you can have for free.

This is my contract with you. If you don't agree, you've been a lovely guest... The code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, which basically is a sticker that says "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! (and don't remove this sticker). COPYRIGHT 2012 SOME RUSSIAN DUDE".

p.s. None of the goals have been reached yet, but there is still determination.    
p.p.s. Unless I am dead or in a coma, I would update this note if the project is cancelled.
