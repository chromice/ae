# æ – minimalist PHP toolkit

æ (pronounced "ash") is a collection of loosely coupled PHP libraries for all your web development needs: request routing, response caching, templating, form validation, image manipulation, and database operations.

This project has been created and maintained by its sole author to explore, validate and express his views on web development. As a result, this is an opinionated codebase that adheres to a few basic principles:

- **Simplicity:** There are no controllers, event emitters and responders, filters, template engines, etc. There is no config file to tinker with. All libraries come with their configuration options set to reasonable defaults.
- **Reliability**: All examples in this documentation are tested and their output verified. [Documentation](index.php) is the spec, [examples](../documentation) are unit tests. The syntax is designed to be expressive and error-resistant. 
- **Performance:** Libraries are loaded when you need them and there is no hidden layer above your code to worry about. Cached responses are served by Apache alone, i.e. without PHP overhead.
- **Independence:** This toolkit does not have any third-party dependencies, nor does it needlessly adhere to any style guide or standard. There are only 6 thousand lines of code written by a single author, so it would not take you long to figure out what all of them do.

There is nothing particularly groundbreaking or fancy about this toolkit. If you are just looking for a simple PHP framework, you may have found it. However, if someone told you that all your code must be broken into models, views and controllers, you will be better off using something like [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com) or [Laravel](http://laravel.com). 

æ will be perfect for you, if your definition of a web application falls along these lines:

> **Opinion:** A web application is a bunch of scripts thrown together to concatenate an HTTP string in response to another HTTP string.

In other words, æ is designed to be as simple as possible, but not simpler. It will not let you forget that most of the back-end programming you do is a glorified string manipulation, but it will remove the most cumbersome aspects of it. 

In more practical terms, if you are putting together a site with a bunch of forms that save data to a database, æ comes with everything you need.

You may still find it useful, even if you are thinking of web app architecture in terms of dispatchers, controllers, events, filters, etc. The author assumes you are working on something complex and wishes you a hearty good luck.

* * *

## Getting started

### Requirements

<!--
    TODO: Make sure all requirement are correct, i.e.  check older versions of Apache and MySQL
-->

- **PHP**: version 5.4 or higher with *GD extension* for image manipulation, and *Multibyte String extension* for form validation.
- **MySQL**: version 5.1 or higher with *InnoDB engine*.
- **Apache**: version 2.0 or higher with *mod_rewrite* for nice URLs, and *mod_deflate* for response compression.


### Manual installation

You can download the latest release manually, drop it into your project and include <samp>ae/loader.php</samp>:

```php
require 'path/to/ae/loader.php';
```

### Configuring Composer

If you are using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), make sure your <samp>composer.json</samp> references this repository AND has æ added as a requirement:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/chromice/ae"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "chromice/ae": "dev-develop"
    }
}
```


### Hello world

Let's create the most basic web application. Put this code into <samp>index.php</samp> in the web root directory:

<?= $example = $doc->example('/001_Hello_world') ?>

You should also instruct Apache to redirect all unresolved URIs to <samp>index.php</samp>, by adding the following rules to <samp>.htaccess</samp> file:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?/$1 [L,QSA]
</IfModule>
```

Now, if you open our app – located at, say, <samp>http://localhost/</samp> – in a browser you should see this:

<?= $example->expect('world.txt') ?>

If you change the address to <samp>http://localhost/universe</samp>, you should see:

<?= $example->on('/universe')->expect('universe.txt') ?>


## Design principles

æ was designed with the following principles in mind:

- Imperative and expressive trumps declarative and formulaic.
- Exceptions are awesome.
- [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) and [template engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_template_engines) are an overkill.

As a result, æ *does not* do anything *magically*: 

1. It only does what it is explicitly told. 
2. It fails fast by throwing exceptions on recoverable state errors, and triggering warnings when you are just being silly.
3. It does not try to reinvent the wheel, and expects you to know how wheels work.


### Imperative and expressive syntax

æ is biased towards imperative style of programming.

<?php $syntax = $doc->example('006_Syntax') ?>

Most methods are chainable, including all setters: 

<?= $syntax->source('options.php') ?>

Some libraries operate on the buffered output, and don't have a corresponding setter at all:

<?= $syntax->source('response.php') ?>

Most of æ code follows these two patterns: 

1. Transformation: `ae::noun()->verb()->...->verb()` 
2. Invocation: `$noun = ae::noun()->...->noun()`.

There are exceptions, of course, like the query builder:

<?= $syntax->source('database.php') ?>


### Exception safety

In order to make your code exception safe, you must be aware the object life cycle.

`__construct()` method is called whenever a new object is instantiated. If the object is assigned to a variable, it will persist until either:

1. the variable is `unset()`
2. the scope where the variable was declared is destroyed, either naturally or *when an exception is thrown*
3. execution of the program halts

`__destruct()` method is called when there are no more variables pointing to the object.

Many æ libraries take advantage of the object life cycle. For instance, internal `\ae\ValueSwitch` class is using it to switch values temporarily:

<?= $switch_example = $doc->example('002_ValueSwitch'); ?>

Which will output:

<?= $switch_example->expect('output.txt') ?>

Buffer, container and response libraries all start capturing output in `__construct()` and process it in `__destruct()`. File library is using  `__destruct()` to unlock previously locked files and close their handles. Database library exposes a transaction object that rolls back any uncommited queries in `__destruct()`.

> **Opinion:** Generally speaking, all resources your object has allocated must be deallocated in the destructor. And if you find yourself cleaning state after catching an exception, you are doing it wrong.


### Everything is a script

> All the world's a stage,   
> And all the men and women merely players.

Strictly speaking æ is not a framework, because it imposes no rules on how your should structure your code: there are no canonical directory structure or file-naming conventions. As far as the author is concerned, all your code may be happily contained in a single <samp>index.php</samp> or be equally happily spread across dozens of directories and hundreds of files.

It would not be unreasonable to assume that it will be one or more PHP scripts that will be responsible for one or more of the following tasks:

- *Handling requests*, i.e. determine what to do based on request URI, GET/POST parameters, form values, etc.
- *Operating on internal state*, e.g. reading/writing files, cookies, session variables, database records, etc.
- *Generating responses*, i.e. spitting out a string giant string conforming to HTTP.

The author does not want to be unfairly prescriptive, so here are just a few tips you may find helpful:

#### Separate different kinds of logic

Here is the top tip for one-file-to-rule-them-all approach: Process input first; *than* execute database queries, check internal state and pre-calculate values; *and than* use those values to generate a response.

<?= $doc->example('/003_Logic_separation') ?>

In MVC-speak your controller is at the top, and your view is at the bottom.



#### Break your app into components

æ lets you either delegate requests to a directory or a file, or process it in anonymous callback function. Typically the first (few) segment(s) should determine the script that should handle the request, while the remainder of the segments further qualify what kind of request it is and specify its parameters.

For example, you may want to handle user authentication and let:

- <samp>/account/login</samp> – Authentication form.
- <samp>/account/logout</samp> – Log user out.
- <samp>/account/edit</samp> – Edit account information.
- <samp>/account</samp> – Display account information.

You may also have a script to display products:

- <samp>/products[/page/{page-number}]</samp> – Display (paginated) list of products.
- <samp>/products/{product-id}/{product-seo-title}</samp> – Display a product page.

And finally, you may want to display some pages:

- <samp>/</samp> – Display home page.
- <samp>/about-us</samp> – Display about us page.
- <samp>/about-us/team</samp> – List team members.

Now, here's what an <samp>index.php</samp> in the web root directory may look like:

<?= $routing = $doc->example('007_Routing'); ?>


<?php $routing->on('/account/login')->outputs('Authentication form.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/account/logout')->outputs('Log user out.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/account/edit')->outputs('Edit account information.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/account')->outputs('Display account information.') ?>


<?php $routing->on('/products')->outputs('List product page #1.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/products/page/33')->outputs('List product page #33.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/products/123')->outputs('Display product #123.') ?>

<?php $routing->on('/')->outputs('Display home page.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/about-us')->outputs('Display about us page.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/about-us/team')->outputs('List team members.') ?>
<?php $routing->on('/unknown-page')->outputs('No page found.') ?>

#### Keep your template code DRY

æ takes advantage of the fact that PHP itself is a powerful template engine and exposes two classes of objects to help you keep your presentation code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself):

1. **Snippet**: for when several scripts are presenting similar looking data. Think: article listings, user profiles, etc.
2. **Container**: for when several scripts are contained within the same template. Think: standard header + various content + standard footer.

##### Snippets

A snippet is a parameterized template, used to present snippets of information in a standardized form.

<?= $snippet = $doc->example('/004_Template_snippet'); ?>

Provided <samp>snippet.php</samp> contains:

<?= $snippet->source('snippet.php') ?>

The script will produce:

<?= $snippet->expect('output.html') ?>

##### Containers

A container is a parameterized template, used as a wrapper. Here's an example of a container:

<?php $container = $doc->example('/005_Template_container'); ?>

<?= $container->source('container.php') ?>

Another script can use it:

<?= $container->source('index.php') ?>

Which will result in:

<?= $container->expect('output.html') ?>

**NB!** The container object is assigned to `$container` variable. The object will persists while the script is being executed, allowing container to capture the content. The container script is always executed *after* the contained script.

### Database

<?php
	$db_test = $doc->example('/____Database_test');
	$db_test->contains('Query #2: SELECT 1');
?>

Database library simplifies building MySQL queries and exposes a simple abstraction for tables and transactions.

Before you can make queries to the database, you have to specify the connection parameters using the options library:

<?= $db_test->source()->lines(3, 8); ?>

Provided the connection parameters are correct and the database ("ae" in this example) exists, you can create a connection and make a query:

<?= $db_test->source()->lines(13, 19); ?>

As you can see, whenever something goes wrong on the database side, the library throws `\ae\DatabaseException`, which you can catch and handle gracefully.

If you want to know what queries are performed and how much memory and time they take, you can turn query logging on:

<?= $db_test->source()->lines(10, 11); ?>

See [Inspector](#inspector) section for more details.

#### Making queries 

<?php 
	$db_example = $doc->example('/____Database');
	$db_output = $db_example->expect('output.txt');
?>

Let's create the "authors" table:

<?= $db_example->source('authors.php')
	->lines(19, 28)
	->replace('{authors}', '{table}')
	->replace('\'authors\'', '\'table\'')
	->replace('static::name()', '\'authors\'')
	->replace('static::database', 'ae::database');
?>

Instead of specifying the table name in the query itself we are using `{table}` placeholder and specify its value via `\ae\Database::aliases()` method. The library will wrap the name with backticks ("`") and replace the placeholder for us.

While not particularly useful in this example, placeholders are generally a good way to keep you query code readable.

Let's fill this table with some data:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(30, 41); ?>

In this example we are using `{data:names}` and `{data:values}` placeholders and specify column names and corresponding values via `\ae\Database::data()` method. Now, I intentionally made a typo in the authors name, so let's fix it:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(46, 57); ?>

In this example we are using `{data:set}` placeholder and specifying its value via `\ae\Database::data()` method, while `\ae\Database::variables()` method will escape the value of `$morgan_id` and replace `{author_id}` placeholder. 

Of course, these are just examples, there is actually a less verbose way to insert and update rows:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(63, 65)->lines(70, 77); ?>

> There is also `\ae\Database::insert_or_update()` method, which you can use to update a row or insert a new one, if it does not exist; `\ae\Database::count()` for counting rows; `\ae\Database::find()` for retrieving a particular row; and `\ae\Database::delete()` for deleting rows from a table. Please consult the source code of the database library to learn more about them.

#### Transactions

A sequence of dependant database queries must always be wrapped in a transaction to prevent race condition and ensure data integrity:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(42, 43)->lines(59, 61)->lines(67, 68); ?>

This way, if one of your SQL queries fails, it will throw an exception and all uncommitted queries will be rolled back, when the `$transaction` object is destroyed.

**NB!** Only one transaction can be open at a time.

#### Retrieving data

Now that we have some rows in the table, let's retrieve and display them:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(99, 107); ?>

This will produce:

<?= $db_example->source('output.txt')->lines(16, 19); ?>

Now, let's change the query so that authors are ordered alphabetically:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(116, 128); ?>

Again, instead of specifying `ORDER BY` clause directly in the query we are using a placeholder for it, that will be filled in only if we specify the clause via `\ae\Database::order_by()` method. 

> Database library has other placeholder/method combinations like this: `{sql:join}` / `join()`, `{sql:where}` / `where()`, `{sql:group_by}` / `group_by()`, `{sql:having}` / `having()` and `{sql:limit}` / `limit()`. They allow you to write complex parameterized queries without concatenating all bits of the query yourself. Please consult the source code of the database library to learn more about them.

Note that we are also using `\ae\DatabaseResult::all()` method to return an array of results, instead of fetching them one by one in a `while` loop. Please note that `\ae\DatabaseResult::fetch()` method is the most memory efficient way of retrieving results.

The example above will produce a list of authors in alphabetical order:

<?= $db_example->source('output.txt')->lines(23, 26); ?>

#### Active record

Database library has `\ae\DatabaseTable` abstract class that your table specific class can extend:

<?= $db_example->source('authors.php')->lines(5, 6)->lines(39, 39)->replace("\n{\n}", ' {}'); ?>

This one line of code is enough to start performing basic CRUD operations for that table:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(140, 149); ?>

As you can see, finding a record does not actually load its data. In some cases you may  want to update some property of an existing record without loading its data:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(155, 160); ?>

Let's create a new record and save it to the database:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(165, 171); ?>

In order to retrieve several records from the database, you would make a regular query, but instead of calling `\ae\Database::result()` method, you should call `\ae\DatabaseTable::many()` method with the name of the table class as the first argument:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(183, 193); ?>

That will output:

<?= $db_example->source('output.txt')->lines(36, 40); ?>

Now, Shakespeare was a playwright, while the rest of the authors are novelists. Let's delete his record:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(199, 199); ?>

#### Relationships

Let's make things more interesting by introducing a new class of objects: books. First, we need to create a table to store them:

<?= $db_example->source('books.php')
	->lines(15, 24)
	->replace('{books}', '{table}')
	->replace('\'books\'', '\'table\'')
	->replace('static::name()', '\'books\'')
	->replace('static::database', 'ae::database');
?>

We also need a class to represent this table. To keep things interesting, we will name it `Novels`. Obviously `\ae\DatabaseTable` won't be able to guess the name of the table, so we will specify it manually by overriding the `\ae\DatabaseTable::name()` method:

<?= $db_example->source('books.php')->lines(6, 11)->lines(64, 64); ?>

> There are several methods you can override like this: `\ae\DatabaseTable::database()` to return a different database connection object; `\ae\DatabaseTable::accessor()` to return an array of primary keys; `\ae\DatabaseTable::columns()` to return an array of data columns.

We could start spawning new books using `Novels::create()` method, like we did with authors, but instead we will incapsulate this functionality into `Authors::add_novel()` method:

<?= $db_example->source('authors.php')->lines(5, 15)->lines(39, 39); ?>

Finally, let's add a few books to the database:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(204, 217); ?>

So far so good. Let's add a method to `Novels` class that will return all book records sorted alphabetically:

<?= $db_example->source('books.php')->lines(6, 11)->lines(55, 64); ?>

Most of this code should be familiar to you. The only novelty is `\ae\Database::joining()` method. The query will retrieve data from both "books" and "authors" tables, and we instruct the database driver to return "books" data as an instance of `Novels` class, and "authors" data as an instance of `Authors` class (first argument) assigned to `author` property (second argument) of the corresponding novel object.

Let's inventory our novel collection:

<?= $db_example->source()->lines(228, 234)->lines(238, 239); ?>

Which will output:

<?= $db_example->source('output.txt')->lines(44, 53); ?>
