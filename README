æ [æʃ] is a web application and content management system development framework written in PHP.

## Philosophy

1. There are many ways around the same problem. Few of them are short, pleasant and easy to find.
2. The tool must fit its purpose. A good tool fits only one.
3. Don't write code that generates code, unless it's boilerplate.
4. 100 lines of code have 10 times less bugs than 1000 lines of code.
5. There is no good code. No code is good code.
6. There is beautiful code. Programmers talk in it to each other.
7. Don't code bullshit.

### Simple to learn

Each library must come with an example of how to use it.

### Simple to use

Libraries must require as little configuration as possible. Method names must be memorable.

### Simple to extend

Libraries should be extended only to add new functionality. Delegation pattern should used in all other cases:

	$utility = new Utility();
	$plugin = new Plugin();

	$utility->connect($plugin);

### Simple to support

Examples must be used as regression tests. Slimmer, well thought through code tend to be less buggy. Complex solutions must be avoided at all cost.
